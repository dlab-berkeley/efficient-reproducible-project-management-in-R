# Efficient and Reproducible Project Management in R

by [Jae Yeon Kim](https://jaeyk.github.io/)

## Overview 

This workshop introduces tools and techniques to make a data science project efficient and reproducible in R. I recommend this workshop (1) if you have experienced difficulties organizing your project or (2) intend to share your code with other researchers (in a team or with the public). Science advances through the accumulation of reliable knowledge. A research project should be at the very least reproducible and efficiently organized and conducted enough to make replication enough easy.

## Learning objectives 

Part 1: Organizing files 
Part 2: Making a project computationally reproducible 
Part 3: Using Git and GitHub for version control and project management

## Prerequisites 

Basic familiarity with R required. 

## Setup 

Install the following three packages in R. 

```r

pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse, # tidyverse 
  usethis, # workflow project management 
  here # computational reproducibility 
  )

```
