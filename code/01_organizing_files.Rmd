# Organizing files 

![](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/efficient-reproducible-project-management-in-R/blob/master/misc/screenshot.png?raw=true)

# (Optional) Project-oriented workflow

Read Jenny Bryan's great article on [project-oriented workflow](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/). The key idea is [computatinoal reproduciblity](http://web.stanford.edu/~vcs/talks/Utah2018-STODDEN.pdf). To ensure that, we need to make a project self-contained.

- Note that `setwd()` is not reproducible outside the author's local machine. Instead, learn to use `here()`'.

- Do not save .RData when you quit R and don't load. Using [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), add the following line in `.bash_profile`: `alias R='R --no-save --no-restore-data'` (More information on [invoking R](https://colinfay.me/intro-to-r/appendix-b-invoking-r.html) by W. N. Venables and D. M. Smith (R Core Team))

# (Required) Project organization

Read [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/index.html)'s article on [project management in RStudio](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/02-project-intro/).

*Tips for file organization*

- See ["Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing"](https://github.com/swcarpentry/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/blob/gh-pages/good-enough-practices-for-scientific-computing.pdf) by [PLOS](https://plos.org/)

- You can create directories on your computer from R using `dir.create` function.

0. Create a project directory 

```{r}
# Create a project directory 
# .. subdirectory 
# I assume that your current working directory is advanced-data-wrangling-in-R. Check this by running `getwd()`

dir.create("../project")

```

1. Treat raw data as read only (raw data should be RAW!)

```{r}
dir.create(here::here("project", "data"))
```

2. Separate read-only data from processed data

```{r}
dir.create(here::here("project", "processed_data"))
```

3. Treat generated outputs as disposable

```{r}
dir.create(here::here("project", "outputs"))
```

4. Separate function definition and application

```{r}
dir.create(here::here("project", "functions"))
```

5. Version control [using Git from RStudio](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/14-supplemental-rstudio/)
