# Setup

```{r}

pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse, # tidyverse 
  here # computational reproducibility 
  )

```

# Motivation 

Why making a project efficient and reproducible matters?

For your self-interest and public goods.

# How to organize files in a project 

Step 1. [Environment](https://environments.rstudio.com/) is part of your project. Don't share them across workspaces. If someone can't reproduce your environment, they are likely facing a problem running your code.

- Tools > Global Options. You should not check Restor .RData ... and set saving workspace option to NEVER.

Step 2. For each project, create a project directory 

```{r}

# Ideally don't name it a project. Use a name that's more informative.

dir.create("../project")

```
Step 3. File > New project > Browse existing directories > Create project This allows each project has its own workspace. 

Step 4. Treat raw data as read only (raw data should be RAW!)

```{r}

dir.create(here::here("project", "data"))

```
Step 5. Separate read-only data from processed data

```{r}

dir.create(here::here("project", "processed_data"))

```

Step 6. Treat generated outputs as disposable

```{r}

dir.create(here::here("project", "outputs"))

```

Step 7. Separate function definition and application

```{r}

dir.create(here::here("project", "functions"))

```
**Challenge 1**
Create directories for a project named "starwars".

# How to organize code in a R markdown file 

- In addition to environment, workflow is an important component of project efficiency and reproducibility. 

![](https://rviews.rstudio.com/post/2017-06-09-What-is-the-tidyverse_files/tidyverse1.png)

- R Markdown basic syntax 

```{r}
# Header 1 
## Header 2 
### Header 3 
```

- Use these section headings to indicate workflow.

```{r}

# Import packages and data 

# Tidy data 

# Transform data 

# Model data 

# Visualize data 

```

- Press `ctrl + shift + o` you can see a document outline based on these headings. This is a nice feature for finding code you need to focus. 

- If your project is large, then divide these sections into files and then number them. 

   - 01_tidying.Rmd
   - 02_transforming.Rmd 
   ... 
   
- You can see that this workshop also follows this guideline.
